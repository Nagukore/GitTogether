Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Script
This project contains a Python script for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset stored in a CSV file. It uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate statistical summaries and visualizations to help understand the dataset.

# Features
 -Loads a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame  
 -Displays basic statistics (mean, min, max, standard deviation, etc.)  
 -Prints the first few rows for an overview of the dataset  
 -Generates histograms to visualize data distribution  
 -Creates a correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships  
 -Generates a pairplot to explore pairwise feature distributions  
 -Saves the statistical summary as a new CSV file (statistics.csv)  

# Requirements  
Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:  
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
## Usage:  
Place your dataset file as data.csv in the project directory.

# Run the script:

python eda_script.py
The script will generate visualizations and save statistical summaries to statistics.csv.

# Output
 #### Visualizations:  
-Histograms of numeric columns.  
-Correlation heatmap.  
-Pairplot of all features.    
#### Statistics file:

statistics.csv containing summary statistics of the dataset
